        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Prepare the necessary ingredients.<br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Wash the chicken wings and dry them with a paper towel. Cut the wings at the joints into 2-3 parts. If you have wings with extreme phalanges, remove them.<br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> For the marinade, combine ketchup (I have a kebab), soy sauce and spicy mustard in a bowl.
Pass the peeled garlic through a press and add it to the rest of the marinade ingredients.<br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Stir until smooth. And put the wings into the resulting marinade. Mix well with your hand.
Marinate the wings for 30 minutes at room temperature or 1 hour in the refrigerator (as long as possible, even the whole night, but an hour will be enough).<br>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> After a while, put the pickled wings in one layer in a baking dish. Spread the remaining marinade over the wings.<br>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong> Cover the mold with foil and put it in a preheated 200 degree oven for 40 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake the wings for another 10 minutes at the same temperature.<br>
        <strong>Step 7:</strong> Chicken wings baked in the oven are ready. Serve the wings to the table hot.<br>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Beat butter and sugar until smooth.<br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> Sift the flour separately. Add soda, egg, milk and flour to the butter and sugar. Whisk everything together thoroughly.<br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> Then, add 4 tablespoons of cocoa to the hot water, mix and add it to the mass. Whisk all the ingredients and get a very thick mass. <br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, we draw a circle on the parchment (square, heart, numbers - to your taste) and distribute our dough according to shape. The height is about 5-7 mm. The cakes are cooked, cooled, and cut off the edges so that the biscuit turns out smooth and beautiful. I gave the cakes to cool down and rest for 3-4 hours. The main thing is not to be warm.<br>
            <strong>Step 5:</strong> Cover with cream completely. Don't worry that the cream will be greasy and satisfying. no! This cream is worthy of all praise! There is never much of it. And now the glaze: in a water bath, melt the chocolate butter and milk, without cooling, pour the glaze on the surface of the cake.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Cut the bacon into cubes. Crush two cloves of garlic with a knife. Heat the frying pan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter and fry the bacon with garlic. Fry on low heat for 10 minutes, the fat should melt out of the bacon, but the bacon should remain soft. After frying, remove the garlic.<br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> In boiling water (2.3 liters), add 1 tablespoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of olive oil and spaghetti. We cook spaghetti as indicated on their packaging, it is important to observe the specified cooking time in order to cook spaghetti correctly.<br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> We separate 3 yolks from proteins. Put the yolks and one egg in a bowl, salt and pepper (1 pinch each), beat well. Add 2 tablespoons of grated cheese, mix.<br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Turn off the heat under the frying pan with bacon, add spaghetti and 1 tablespoon of butter.
Pour in the beaten eggs with cheese, mix everything thoroughly.Gradually add 300 ml of broth (water) from the spaghetti and mix constantly, the eggs should not curdle.<br>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> To thicken the sauce a little, turn on a low heat under the pan and stir constantly for about 1 minute so that the eggs do not boil. If the sauce turns out to be very thick, you can add more broth.<br>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong> Spread the spaghetti on a plate, sprinkle with ground black pepper and grated cheese on top. Pasta carbonara is ready.<br>
